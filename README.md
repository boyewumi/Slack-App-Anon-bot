# Botivity: anon-bot

## Project Background
The Botivity team is building a Slack bot that allows you to ask anonymous questions in your Slack workspace without risk of embarrassing yourself.

Using the [Botkit](https://botkit.ai/) framework, we have integrated ways to ask questions and up-vote to questions using Slack's amazing features.

# Using the anon-bot:

Slack slash commands:

- `/ask ${message}` --> Posts message onto desired channel.
- `/ask-block [@users]` --> Slack admin users have the ability to block users from using the anon-bot. Blocked user are not able to ask questions.
- `/ask-unblock [@users]` --> Slack admin users have the ability to un-block users from using the anon-bot.

With more features to come!
